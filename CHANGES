Revision history for POE::Component::Client::Ping
=================================================

Changes marked with "(!!!)" may break backward compatibility.  Changes
marked with "(???)" are just information.

Note to self: Don't forget to tag the version after a new distribution
is released.  For example: `cvs tag -Rc v1_00 .'

---------------
0.90 2000.08.??
---------------

Initial release.  Arbitrarily versioned at 0.90 to indicate pretty
good stability but the need for some beta testing.

Extracted the "Pinger" component code from poing, cleaned it up,
redesigned the interface so several sessions can request multiple
simultaneous pings from a single Ping component, commented the code,
documented it, and made it a module.
